# Deep-learning-project
This project uses TensorFlow to build and train a deep learning model to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

Google Colab

Matplotlib

 How to Run:

Clone this repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.

Install the required libraries (TensorFlow, matplotlib).

Load the dataset and run the notebook cells step by step.

Visualize training graphs and sample predictions.

 Files Included:

mnist_classification.ipynb — The complete code notebook.

mnist_model.h5 — Trained model file.

Graph images — Accuracy & Loss curves.

 Results:

Achieved approximately 97% accuracy on the MNIST test set.

Plotted training vs validation accuracy and loss graphs.

Displayed sample predictions on test images.

Future Work:

Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for even higher accuracy.

Apply data augmentation for better generalization.

Deploy the trained model as a web or mobile application.
